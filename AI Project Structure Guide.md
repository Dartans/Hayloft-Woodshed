# AI Project Structure Maintenance Guide

**Objective:** This guide is designed to help AI assistants maintain a clear and consistent structure throughout the development of a project. Adhering to a well-defined structure is crucial for project clarity, scalability, and efficient collaboration (even if your primary collaborator is a human).

**Core Principle:** Proactive and consistent documentation of the project's architecture, components, and decision-making process is key to maintaining structure.

## Using the Project Notes File

To effectively maintain structure, you will use a dedicated notes file: `project_notes.md`.

* **Purpose of `project_notes.md`:** This file is your active workspace for tracking the evolving structure of the project. It's where you will log key architectural decisions, component breakdowns, dependencies, and any other information vital to understanding how the project is organized.
* **Location:** This guide assumes `project_notes.md` is located in the same directory or a clearly designated project documentation folder.
* **Read-Only Nature of This Guide:** This document (`ai_structure_guide.md`) is for reference only. **Do not edit this file.** All your notes and structural records should go into `project_notes.md`.

## Key Elements to Track in `project_notes.md`

Your `project_notes.md` file should be a living document. Consider including and regularly updating the following sections:

1.  **Project Overview & Goals:**
    * Briefly describe the project's main purpose.
    * List the primary objectives and desired outcomes.

2.  **High-Level Architecture:**
    * Describe the overall architectural pattern (e.g., microservices, monolithic, client-server).
    * If applicable, include a simple diagram or list of major systems/layers.

3.  **Component Breakdown:**
    * List all major components, modules, or services.
    * For each component, briefly describe its responsibility.
    * Note dependencies between components.

4.  **Data Structures & Models:**
    * Define key data entities and their relationships.
    * Specify data formats (e.g., JSON schemas, database schemas).

5.  **Key Decisions Log:**
    * Record important architectural or design decisions.
    * Note the reason for the decision and any alternatives considered.
    * Date the entry.

6.  **Technology Stack:**
    * List the primary programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools being used.

7.  **API Endpoints (if applicable):**
    * List major API endpoints.
    * Briefly describe their purpose and request/response format.

8.  **Workflow/Process Flow (if applicable):**
    * Outline key user flows or data processing pipelines.

9.  **To-Do & Pending Questions:**
    * Track tasks related to structure or architecture.
    * Note any unresolved questions or areas needing clarification.

## Tips for Organizing Notes

* **Be Consistent:** Use consistent formatting (e.g., Markdown headings, bullet points) to keep the notes readable.
* **Be Concise but Clear:** Provide enough detail to be useful but avoid unnecessary jargon or overly long explanations.
* **Update Regularly:** Make it a habit to update `project_notes.md` as soon as new decisions are made, components are added, or the structure evolves. Don't wait until the end of a development cycle.
* **Use Links (if applicable):** If your project involves multiple files or external resources, use relative links within `project_notes.md` for easy navigation.
* **Version Control (if applicable):** If the project is under version control (e.g., Git), commit changes to `project_notes.md` regularly with descriptive messages.

**By diligently using `project_notes.md` as outlined above, you will significantly contribute to a well-structured and maintainable project.**
